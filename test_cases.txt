During the whole testing process, we use the firefox explorer to set our virtual machine as the proxy. We use the test tools like Restclient and use the web browsers.
Sometimes the web browsers send unrelated requests in the background and cache web pages locally which might be troublesome.

Moreover, it might take a little while to access a web page via proxy, if the locker web browsers doesnt send the request, a simple refresh can works.

Here we gives the list of the websites we tested on:

GET (CONNECT) https://www.youtube.com

GET (CONNECT) https://www.wikipedia.org/

POST http://ptsv2.com/t/ece-568/post

GET then POST http://httpbin.org/forms/post

GET  http://www.httpwatch.com/httpgallery/chunked/chunkedimage.aspx
(chunked image data, both http and https work fine)
